# Hi, I'm Koushik 👋  

I am a **Cybersecurity Professional** with a strong foundation in **Penetration Testing, SOC operations, Network Security, and Cloud Security**. Currently pursuing my **M.S. in Cybersecurity at the University of South Florida (2023–2025)**, I am passionate about solving complex security challenges, analyzing threats, and designing secure architectures across enterprise networks and cloud platforms.  

My journey in tech has given me exposure to **offensive security, digital forensics, vulnerability management, and cloud technologies**. I enjoy working on hands-on projects that combine both defensive and offensive security skills — from building attack simulations in a controlled lab to securing DNS traffic and implementing Nessus/Nmap scans for vulnerability assessments. I also bring professional experience as a **Customer Support Executive**, where I learned to manage high-volume operations and improve processes with attention to detail — a skill that translates directly into security monitoring and SOC analyst work.
